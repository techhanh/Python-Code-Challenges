**Problem Statement**
- Create a function named get_highest_rated that is responsible for finding the highest rated restaurant (from a list of restaurants with its rating)
- This function should take in a list of dictionaries named restaurants as a parameter. Each dictionary represents the data associated with a restaurant, including its rating. This function should have a return value of the restaurant with the highest rating.

**Prompts**
List three or more questions whose answers would clarify the problem statement. For each question, provide an answer which includes the effect your decision would have on how you would approach the problem.

1. What happens if there are multiple restaurants with the same highest rating?
    - all restaurants with the same highest rating should be outputted
2. What happens if there is no rating available yet for this restaurant (edge case test)?
    - It should output a string as “Rating Not Available”
3. What happens if a rating is a string instead of a numeric value?
    - an error message should occur

Use the comments provided to write at least two example input/outputs.
1. Consider at least one nominal and one edge case.
    a. nominal test1: 3 different restaurant name with 3 different ratings
    b. nominal test2: different restaurant with same highest ratings
    c. edge case test1: a restaurant that has a blank rating
    d. edge case test2: a rating that is not a numeric value
    
2. What is the expected output for the given input?
