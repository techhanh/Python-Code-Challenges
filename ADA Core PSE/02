**Problem Statement**

Imagine programming the logic for a word game. In this game, every player submits one word. Each word gets a score based on the letters in the word and its point value.
- Create a function named score that is responsible for scoring a given word.
- This function should take in a string named word as a parameter.
- This function should return the word’s total number of points

Refer to this table for the point vales of each letter:
Letter	                          Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T	    1
D, G	                            2
B, C, M, P	                      3
F, H, V, W, Y	                    4
K	                                5
J, X	                            8
Q, Z	                            10

Example:
Input	    Expected Output
"DOG"	    5
"CAT"	    5
"CABBAGE" 14
"QUARTZ"  24


**Prompts**

List three or more questions whose answers would clarify the problem statement. For each question, provide an answer which includes the effect your decision would have on how you would approach the problem.

1. What if there is a blank input?
    -blank returns 0
    
2. What if there is an invalid input (something else other than an alphabetical character like a number or symbol?)
    -invalid character returns TypeError (should be alphabetic characters only)

3. What happens if one or more of the character is lowercase?
    -use the .upper() method so the return value would not be affected
    
4. What happens if there are multiple words in a string ?
    -use the .replace(” “, “”) method so the return value would not be affected
        
        (the method removes all the empty spaces in a string)


**Challenge 1: Writing Test**

1. Use the comments provided to write at least two example inputs/outputs?
2. Write unit tests for score for the nominal and edge cases you identified in the first step.
