**Problem Statement**

Imagine programming the logic for a word game. In this game, every player submits one word. Each word gets a score based on the letters in the word and its point value.
- Create a function named score that is responsible for scoring a given word.
- This function should take in a string named word as a parameter.
- This function should return the wordâ€™s total number of points

Refer to this table for the point vales of each letter:
Letter	                          Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T	    1
D, G	                            2
B, C, M, P	                      3
F, H, V, W, Y	                    4
K	                                5
J, X	                            8
Q, Z	                            10
