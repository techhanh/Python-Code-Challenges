**Problem Statement**

Imagine programming the logic for a word game. In this game, every player submits one word. Each word gets a score based on the letters in the word and its point value.
- Create a function named score that is responsible for scoring a given word.
- This function should take in a string named word as a parameter.
- This function should return the wordâ€™s total number of points

Refer to this table for the point vales of each letter:
Letter	                          Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T	    1
D, G	                            2
B, C, M, P	                      3
F, H, V, W, Y	                    4
K	                                5
J, X	                            8
Q, Z	                            10

Example:
Input	    Expected Output
"DOG"	    5
"CAT"	    5
"CABBAGE" 14
"QUARTZ"  24


**Prompts**

List three or more questions whose answers would clarify the problem statement. For each question, provide an answer which includes the effect your decision would have on how you would approach the problem.

1. What if there is a blank input?
    -blank returns 0
    
2. What if there is an invalid input (something else other than an alphabetical character like a number or symbol?)
    -invalid character returns TypeError (should be alphabetic characters only)
